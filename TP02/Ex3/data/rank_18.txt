Let's dance
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance
To the song they're playin' on the radio

Let's sway
While colour lights up your face
Let's sway
Sway through the crowd to an empty space

Chorus:
If you say run, I'll run with you
If you say hide, we'll hide
Because my love for you
Would break my heart in two
If you should fall
Into my arms
And tremble like a flower

Let's dance
For fear your grace should fall
Let's dance
For fear tonight is all

Let's sway
You could look into my eyes
Let's sway
Under the moonlight, this serious moonlight

Chorus

Let's dance
Put on your red shoes and dance the blues
Let's dance
To the song they're playin' on the radio

Let's sway
You could look into my eyes
Let's sway
Under the moonlight, this serious moonlight
