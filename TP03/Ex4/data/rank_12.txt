Just you and I,
sharing our love together.
And I know in time,
we'll build the dreams we treasure.
We'll be all right, just you and I.

Just you and I
Just you and I

Sharing our love together

and I know in time,
and I know in time,

we'll build the dreams we treasure.
And we'll be all right,
just you and I.

CHORUS:
And I remember our first embrace,
that smile that was on your face,
the promises that we made.
And now your love is my reward,
and I love you even more,
than I ever did before.

Just you and I
Just you and I

We can entrust each other,

with you in my life,
with you in my life,

they'll never be another.
We'll be all right,
just you and I.

Chorus

We made it you and I.
